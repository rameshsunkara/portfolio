I am a Full Stack Developer with over 9 years of experience in building software applications to solve complex problems lucidly.

I strongly believe in minimalistic solutions which are scalable. I am passionate about design and architecture of the systems which are enormously scalable, reactive and most importantly usable.

Being a constant learner, I love prototyping.
I have a strong niche for Product Management and of course I enjoy teamwork.
